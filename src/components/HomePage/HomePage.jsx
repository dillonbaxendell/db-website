            My name is Dillon Baxendell. Iâ€™m a frontend software engineer &
            freelance web developer in Los Angeles -- with roots in digital
            marketing & SEO. I'm passionate about music, technology and
            basically everything that makes the internet tick.
          </p>
          <p>
            My work currently consists of a full time engineering role at The
            Noun Project (working on Lingo) & managing ongoing freelance clients
            and side projects. I find this balancing act to be super resourceful
            in terms my learning as a web developer, as well as for keeping up
            with the rapid expansion of developer tools, libraries, frameworks,
            etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            My freelance web development roots are in Wordpress & Shopify, of
            which I'm self taught. In 2017, I started at UCLA to broaden my
            knowledge of the Node.js ecosystem. Since then, I fell in love with
            & have been primarily using React & Redux in web applications. For
            static sites, I love using Gatsby for creating blazing fast,
            SEO-driven headless frontend user interfaces.

            web development project with a freelance web developer, a developer
            looking to collaborate on something cool, or just wanting to say hi,
            shoot me a message and let's work together.
